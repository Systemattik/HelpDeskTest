# Azure Cloud IT Help Desk (Cost-Constrained Design)

This project demonstrates the design of a cloud-based IT help desk system using Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Storage, with a serverless automation layer intentionally not deployed to maintain zero operational cost.

## Current Implementation
- Static web frontend hosted on Azure Static Web Apps
- Ticket submission form
- Azure Storage account for ticket data

## Planned Architecture
A serverless automation layer using Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions was designed but not deployed due to cost considerations.

## Cost Considerations
All deployed components remain within Azure Free Tier limits.
